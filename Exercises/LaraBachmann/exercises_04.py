# Extend the simulated computer from the second week:
# You will need to support a number of additional opcodes:
# - 3: read a single integer as input and save it to the position given
#      by its only parameter. the command 3,19 would read an input
#      and store the result at address 19
# - 4: output the value of the single parameter for this opcode.
#      for example 4,19 would output the value stored at address 19
# - 5: jump-if-true: if the first parameter is non-zero, it sets the instruction pointer to the value from the second parameter. Otherwise, it does nothing.
# - 6: jump-if-false: if the first parameter is zero, it sets the instruction pointer to the value from the second parameter. Otherwise, it does nothing.
# - 7: less than: if the first parameter is less than the second parameter, it stores 1 in the position given by the third parameter. Otherwise, it stores 0.
# - 8: equals: if the first parameter is equal to the second parameter, it stores 1 in the position given by the third parameter. Otherwise, it stores 0.
#
# caution: since these opcodes expect a variable number of parameters the instruction pointer after executing an instruction should no longer always
# increase by four. Instead, it should increase  according to the number of parameters that instruction expects.
# If, however, the opcode directly manipulates the instruction pointer (5 and 6) there should be no additional modification of the instruction pointer.
# The next instruction to execute is stored directly at the location indicated by the parameter to these opcodes.
# caution: numbers in your storage, as well as inputs can be negative!
#
# Additionally, you need to support two different parameter modes: position mode (mode 0), and immediate mode (mode 1).
# Position mode: Opcode arguments are memory addresses. If an argument has the value 18 you fetch the 'calculation value'
#   from the memory at address 18. This is the mode you already know from last time.
# Immediate mode: In immediate mode a parameter is directly interpreted as a value. If the first argument to the 'sum' opcode is 8
#   then the first summand in your calculation is 8.
#
# Parameter modes are specified per-parameter as part of the opcode by extending the opcodes.
# When reading a number that specifies an opcode
#   - the two right-most digits contain the actual opcode
#   - any further digits contain the parameter mode of the parameters, reading digits from right-to-left
#     and parameters in-order from left to right. Any unspecified digits default to 0 (position mode).
#     NOTE: parameters for the target address of a write operation (e.g. the third parameter of the 'sum' or 'multiply' opcode)
#           are never given in immediate mode.
#
# Here's an example:
#   consider the sequence of instructions `1002,4,3,4,33`.
#   The two right-most digits of the first entry ('02') indicate the opcode: multiplication
#   Then, from right to left the next digit is '0', indicating that the first parameter is in position mode.
#   The next digit is '1' indicating the second parameter is in immediate mode.
#   The next digit is not present, defaulting to '0' so the third parameter is again in position mode.
#   No further parameter modes need to be determined as the multiply instruction accepts 3 parameters.
#   Reading the first parameter in position mode is the value at address '4' -- 33.
#   Reading the second parameter in immediate mode is the value '3'.
#   Executing the multiplication instruction gives us the result 33*3=99
#   The third parameter (4) in position mode assigns this value to the memory in location 4 (the location that used
#   to have value 33 is now 99).
#   Now moving the instruction pointer forward brings us to position 4 with opcode 99, halting the program.
#
# And here's some test cases:
#   3,9,8,9,10,9,4,9,99,-1,8 -- test whether the input is equal to 8 (using position mode)
#   3,3,1107,-1,8,3,4,3,99 -- test whether the input is less than 8 (using immediate mode)
#   3,3,1105,-1,9,1101,0,0,12,4,12,99,1 -- test whether the input is 0 using jump instructions
#
# Finally, run you code for the following instructions; when asked for input provide the number '5'. The program should print a single number when executed.
# Please take note of that number in your PR, so I don't need to run all the files myself :)
