# For this weeeks exercise you again need to add a feature to your existing simulated computer:

# - The computer needs to implement memory much /larger/ than the set of initial commands.
#   Any memory address not part of the initial commands can be assumed to be initialized to 0.
#   Only positive addresses are valid, but any positive address can be both read and written.
# - You need to support a new parameter mode, called 'relative mode', and denoted as mode 2 in 
#   the 'mode' part of the instructions.
#   Relative mode is similar to position mode (the first access mode you implemented). However, 
#   parameters in relative mode count not from 0, but from a value called 'relative offset'. 
#   When the computer is initialized, the relative offset is initialized to 0, and as long as it remains
#   0 relative mode and position mode are identical.
#   In general though parameters in relative mode address the memory location at 'relative offset + parameter value'.
#   EXAMPLE: if the relative offset is 50, the mode is 2, and the value you read from memory is 7 you should 
#     retrieve data from the memory address 57.
#     Equally, if you read -7, you should retrieve data from the memory address 43.
#   This applies to both read- and write operations (!)

# - You need to implement a new opcode, opcode 9. opcode 9 adjusts the relative offset by the value of its only parameter.
#   the offset increases by the value of the parameter (or decreases if the parameter value is negative).

# Here is a short program to test your implementation:
#   [109,1,204,-1,1001,100,1,100,1008,100,16,101,1006,101,0,99] should output a copy of itself
#   
# The actual input is in a separate file, input_memory_01.txt under the `data` folder.
# When asked for input provide the value 2. There should be a single output. Please include it in your PR.
