# to solve todays exercise you will need a fully functional int-computer,
# including relative offset features. If you did not complete the last exercise
# please ask one of the other students to share their implementation of the
# int-computer with you.
#
#
# We will run 'breakout' -- the arcade game -- on our simulated computer. 
# (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakout_(video_game))
# The code for the computer will be provided under data/breakout_commands.txt
# the code will produce outputs in triplets. every triplet that is output
# specifies (x-position, y-position, tile_type).
# tiles can be of the following types:
# 0: empty tile
# 1: wall. walls are indestructible
# 2: block. blocks can be destroyed by the ball
# 3: paddle. the paddle is indestructible
# 4: ball. the ball moves diagonally and bounces off objects
# 
# EXAMPLE:
# a sequence of output values like 1, 2, 3, 6, 5, 4 would
#  - draw a paddle (type 3) at x=1, y=2
#  - draw the ball (type 4) at x=6, y=5
#
#
# PART 1:
# run the game until it exits. Analyse the output produced during the run, and create
# a visual representation (matplotlib or ascii-art are possibilities here...) of the screen display.
# mark the different tile types as different colors or symbols. Upload the picture with your PR.
#
# PART 2:
# The game didn't actually run in part 1, it just drew a single static screen.
# Change the first instruction of the commands from 1 to 2. Now the game will actually run.
# when the game actually runs you need to provide inputs to steer the paddle. whenever the computer
# requests you to provide an input, you can chose to provide
# -  0: the paddle remains in position
# - -1: move the paddle to the left
# - +1: move the paddle to the right
#
# the game also outputs a score. when an output triplet is in position (-1, 0) the third value of
# the triplet is not a tile type, but your current score.
# You need to beat the game by breaking all tiles without ever letting the ball cross the bottom 
# edge of the screen. What is your high-score at the end of the game? provide the score as part of your PR.
#
# BONUS: (no extra points, just for fun)
# make a movie of playing the game :)
