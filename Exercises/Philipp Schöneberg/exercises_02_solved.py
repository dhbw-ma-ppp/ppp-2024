# Write a function that takes as input a list of integers and returns a single integer number.
# the numbers passed as argument form the working memory of a simulated computer.
# this computer will start by looking at the first value in the list passed to the function.
# this value will contain an `opcode`. Valid opcodes are 1, 2 or 99.
# Encountering any other value when you expect an opcode indicates an error in your coding.
# Meaning of opcodes:
#  1 indicates addition. If you encounter the opcode 1 you should read values from two positions 
#    of your working memory, add them, and store the result in a third position of your working memory.
#    The three numbers immediately after your opcode indicate the memory locations to read (first two values)
#    and write (third value) respectively. 
#    After executing the addition you should move to the next opcode by stepping forward 4 positions.
#  2 indicates multiplication. Otherwise the same rules apply as for opcode 1.
# 99 indicates halt. the program should stop after encountering the opcode 99.
# After the program stops, the function should return the value in the first location (address 0) 
# of your working memory.

# As an example, if the list of integers passed to your function is 
# [1, 0, 0, 0, 99] the 1 in the first position indicates you should read the values
# at position given by the second and third entries. Both of these indicate position 0, so you should read the value
# at position 0 twice. That value is 1. Adding 1 and 1 gives you two. You then look at the value in the fourth
# position, which is again 0, so you write the result to position 0. You then step forward by 4 steps, arriving at 99
# and ending the program. The final memory looks like [2, 0, 0, 0, 99]. Your function should return 2.

# Here's another testcase:
# [1, 1, 1, 4, 99, 5, 6, 0, 99] should become [30, 1, 1, 4, 2, 5, 6, 0, 99]
# Your function should return 30.


# print out which value is returned by your function for the following list:
commands = [1, 12, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 3, 1, 5, 0, 3, 2, 1, 9, 19, 1, 5, 19, 23, 1, 6, 23, 27, 1, 27, 10, 31, 1, 31, 5, 35, 2, 10, 35, 39, 1, 9, 39, 43, 1, 43, 5, 47, 1, 47, 6, 51, 2, 51, 6, 55, 1, 13, 55, 59, 2, 6, 59, 63, 1, 63, 5, 67, 2, 10, 67, 71, 1, 9, 71, 75, 1, 75, 13, 79, 1, 10, 79, 83, 2, 83, 13, 87, 1, 87, 6, 91, 1, 5, 91, 95, 2, 95, 9, 99, 1, 5, 99, 103, 1, 103, 6, 107, 2, 107, 13, 111, 1, 111, 10, 115, 2, 10, 115, 119, 1, 9, 119, 123, 1, 123, 9, 127, 1, 13, 127, 131, 2, 10, 131, 135, 1, 135, 5, 139, 1, 2, 139, 143, 1, 143, 5, 0, 99, 2, 0, 14, 0]
