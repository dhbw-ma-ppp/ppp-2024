- Solve the exercise described at https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/15 using the data at `data/exercise_cave.txt` as input. Prepare a PR as usual.

- Prepare for next Friday by forming groups of 2 (4 with task splitting), and deciding on the rough outline of the analytical app you'd like to build. 
  - Take a look at the datasets available e.g. at
    - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets
    - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/datasets
    - https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html
  - Have some initial idea of what you want to achieve
  - No need to prepare any code yet. You will have the entire lecture on Friday to start working.
